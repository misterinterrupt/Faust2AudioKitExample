# Faust2AudioKitExample
A reference to help create a more full featured version for the faust2audiokit compiler.

This is a quick and dirty example of making a custom dsp node in AK5 using a simple saw oscillator in Faust

Parameters are not hooked up, brittleness level is high

Since AK5 is a moving target, this works with AK commit 6546528fdfffae2a6a839a38b38ecb146dff280b
